#
## WARNING AND HISTORICAL NOTE
#
# When the DenyEC2NonNitroInstances policy was first introduced, it was primarily intended
# to ensure that network traffic was encrypted in transit, which was seen to be a feature
# that all Nitro instances supported and all non-Nitro instances did not. However, this
# is not the case, as instance families such as `a1`, `t3`, and `t4g` are Nitro based but
# do not support network traffic encryption in transit.
#
# As such, the DenyEC2NonNitroInstances policy is no longer a reliable way to ensure that
# network traffic is encrypted in transit. It is recommended that you use the
# DenyEC2InstancesWithoutEncryptionInTransit policy (below) instead if that is your goal.

# This policy denies instance families that aren't based on the Nitro system as documented in the following document:
# https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html#ec2-nitro-instances
# The listing below *are* Nitro-based instances. Most are collected from the following CLI query:
#     aws ec2 describe-instance-types \
#        --filters Name=hypervisor,Values=nitro \
#        --query "InstanceTypes[*].[InstanceType]" --output text | cut -f 1 -d. | sort | uniq
#
# However, that the command only lists instance types available in the default region. To be
# fully comprehensive, the command should be run in all regions where instances are launched.
# As a shortcut, we only run the command in us-east-1, us-west-2, and eu-north-1, as these
# regions combined appear to cover all instance types.
#
# In order to fit within the 5120-character limit for policies
# (See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/org_troubleshoot_policies.html )
# only the instance family is checked, not the specific instance type. AWS support
# has confirmed that this is in fact correct, and spot checking has failed to
# find any instance families that have some sizes based on Nitro and some not.
