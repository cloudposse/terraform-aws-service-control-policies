# Requires parameter:
#  - s3_regions_lockdown # Comma separated list of regions or region patterns in which to allow S3 bucket creation
#
# NOTE: "us-east-1" is the default region, and is indicated by `s3:LocationConstraint`
#       being null. We allow "us-east-1" as a value because it is easier and does not
#       hurt, but it is not effective. We have to test for the presence of the value
#       (or lack thereof) to manage that region, which we do with a separate test.
