It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).







We literally have [*hundreds of terraform modules*][terraform_modules] that are Open Source and well-maintained. Check them out!






## Introduction

Service Control Policies are configured in YAML configuration files.

We maintain a comprehensive [catalog](catalog) of SCP configurations and welcome contributions via pull request!

The [example](examples/complete) in this module uses the catalog to provision the SCPs on AWS.

## Security & Compliance [<img src="https://cloudposse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/bridgecrew.svg" width="250" align="right" />](https://bridgecrew.io/)

Security scanning is graciously provided by Bridgecrew. Bridgecrew is the leading fully hosted, cloud-native solution providing continuous Terraform security and compliance.

## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** We do not pin modules to versions in our examples because of the
difficulty of keeping the versions in the documentation in sync with the latest released versions.
We highly recommend that in your code you pin the version to the exact version you are
using so that your infrastructure remains stable, and update versions in a
systematic way so that they do not catch you by surprise.

Also, because of a bug in the Terraform registry ([hashicorp/terraform#21417](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/21417)),
the registry shows many of our inputs as required when in fact they are optional.
The table below correctly indicates which inputs are required.


For a complete example, see [examples/complete](examples/complete).

For automated tests of the complete example using [bats](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) and [Terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)
(which tests and deploys the example on Datadog), see [test](test).


```hcl
  module "yaml_config" {
    source = "cloudposse/config/yaml"
    # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
    # version     = "x.x.x"

    list_config_local_base_path = path.module
    list_config_paths           = ["catalog/*.yaml"]

    context = module.this.context
  }

  data "aws_caller_identity" "this" {}

  module "service_control_policies" {
    source = "../../"

    service_control_policy_statements  = module.yaml_config.list_configs
    service_control_policy_description = var.service_control_policy_description
    target_id                          = data.aws_caller_identity.this.account_id

    context = module.this.context
  }
```
